      Like so many others in the arts sector, the novel coronavirus has had a substantial
      impact on the television industry.
      Upon the beginning of restrictions and stay-at-home orders last spring,
      production was either shut down or delayed,
      forcing networks to become dependent on their remaining inventory.
      This resulted in the the delay of some completed programs to air as contingencies
      in place of other programs, as well as forcing many shows to air ersatz season
      finales for series whose production was interrupted.
      And thanks to the still-raging pandemic, production of scripted television
      remains largely delayed throughout the country, making it impossible for networks to premiere most of their shows -- both new and old -- in late September and
      early October.
      Facing the reality networks won't have new episodes to air until at least late October or early November, executives had to get creative this fall to fill the gaps.

          Heavier reliance on more acquisitions and imported content
        </div>
        <div class="font-size" id="grafs">
          One way broadcast networks are bridging the gaps are by relying on imported shows,
          from both other platforms and countries. CBS will pull from ViacomCBS's
          existing programs, airing “Star Trek: Discovery,” from the CBS
          All Access streaming site, and “One Day at a Time,”
          a comedy reboot that originated on Netflix but was canceled before
          moving to the ViacomCBS-owned cable network Pop.
          Meanwhile, Fox has acquired “L.A.’s Finest,” a crime drama that originally aired
          on the Spectrum cable system. Networks also went beyond U.S. borders
          to find content. Two examples: The NBC medical drama “Transplant” is
          a Canadian production, and The CW has “Devils,” a financial thriller
          made in Italy.

          A rise in non-scripted productions
        </div>
        <div class="font-size" id="grafs">
          Networks have also upped their non-scripted content, as compared with
          scripted programming, producers can turn around new episodes of
          reality shows, talent competitions, and game shows much faster.
          CBS will continue airing nightly the second season of "Love Island," and
          "Big Brother," a summertime affair that is filling three
          different time slots for the network.
          ABC will also lean heavily on unscripted fare, with returning staples
          "Dancing With the Stars," “Shark Tank,” and “The Bachelorette."
          Additionally, singing competitions will be back in full force with NBC airing "The Voice"
          and Fox airing "The Masked Singer."

          Fall sports
        </div>
        <div class="font-size" id="grafs">
          The return of sports is a coup for TV networks, as live sports
          account for the majority of the most-watched broadcasts
          every year, only growing more important as more viewers
          have switched to streaming services for content.
          This fall, sports fans will be inundated with choices.
          Never before have competitions in all the major U.S. sports
          leagues -- football, basketball, baseball, soccer,
          hockey, tennis, and golf -- happened at the same time.
          Along with golf and tennis,
          The National Basketball Association and National Hockey League
          are staging their championships in the fall for the first time.
